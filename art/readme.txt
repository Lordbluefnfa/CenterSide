Hey!

This mod has started development more than a year ago!
Since then, it has been posted and now TWO updates are completed!

I want to thank all people whom have supported this project! 
Wether it's by making fan-art, posting showcase videos and what not, you'll always be coolswag in my heart!
This update is rather small, regarding to the fact that I'm struggling with some mental health issues.

If there is one thing I can learn from working on this mod, is that please, please take breaks.

That being said, enjoy playing the funny rapping game mod. :)
