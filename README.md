Friday Night Funkin Left Sides Was... Yeah you get it.

This is just a basic ass remix mod.

However.

It has dialogue, weeks that are in chronological order, dope ass effects, dope ass menu, dope ass reskins/reanimations.

And

A dope ass Doodles Menu!!!

# What is the doodles menu???

Since you asked, the doodles menu has sketches and artwork (relating to FNFLS) by the man himself, PurpleInsomnia.

you might find a secret ;)

# What is the so called; "Dope Ass Menu"???

Okay the dope ass menu looks cool.

Including spikes.
Fancy Layouts.
And More!

# RESKINS

(Almost) Every week has a different reskin for BF and GF:

- Week 4 - Date outfits(?)
- Week 5 - Winter/Christmas (duh)

# Dope Ass Effects

These effects are pretty cool (and a pain in the ass to code in)

These Include;
- Fade and Flash (Dims the game slightly while the screen will flash a color depending on what note you hit (NOTE THAT IF FLASHING LIGHTS IS OFF, THIS EFFECT WONT WORK!) The camera will also zoom in intensl with every beat)
- Note Center (Turns on middlescroll on AND hides the game.
- Lovey Dovey (Turns on heart particles that float accross the screen (very cool))
- and theres more. but I'm to lazy to list them lmao

# Stages

The stage redesign is absolutely dope 

heres some cool things that they do

- WEEK 1 STAGE - The time of day will change based on how far you've progressed throughout the week
- WEEK 2 STAGE - The thunder effect is COMPLETELY RANDOM! the camera is also zoomed out more AND the stars move as the song progresses
- WEEK 3 STAGE - Gf's hair wont blow because it take place indoors. HOWEVER, cool sunset.
- WEEK 4 STAGE - Nothing much changes, BUT in milf, there will be ;)
- WEEK 5 STAGE - The crowds expression changes based on the song that you play (Happy for Cocoa, angry for Eggnog, My dad for Winter Horrorland)

# Dialogue

The dialogue box sprites have been reworked to make low end PC guys' computer run the game better when dialogue starts.

There is also a cool arrow button ðŸ˜Ž

The portraits are not animated YET however there are a BUNCH of expresions to choose from (If you want to make like a fan mod or something)

# Engine Reworks

FNF Left Sides is built on what I think is version 4.3 of Psyche Engine **WITH** some engine reworks from me

This includes,
- The Better Menu.
- New Rating Strings.
- Loading Screen
- Warning Menu
- A more decorated Freeplay Menu.

# End Info

That pretty much sumarizes something I've been working on for a LONG time.

Thanks for downloading
