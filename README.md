Since you asked, the doodles menu has sketches and artwork (relating to FNFLS) by the man himself, PurpleInsomnia.

# DOPE ASS Reanimations
Left Sides takes the basic FNF chartacters and reanimates them based on their personality in the mod.

BOYFRIEND:
- Cool, Stylish Up pose
- Does hand gestures with every pose (excluding Idle, Idle-Scared, and Down)
- Looks towards the opponent (Relative dirction ig)

GIRLFRIEND:
- Cutely Smiles (chad) instead of having her smile with her mouth open (virgin)
- Blushes when cheers.
- Lip Sync on singing poses.

DAD:
- Stiff ass mf

Pico:
- He has a hat
- Lip Syncing

Mom:
- I forgor :skull:

Parents:
- Dad is still stiff
- Alternate Idle Animation

Monster:
- I spit some weird shit at you (not stollen from D sides)

# RESKINS

(Almost) Every week ha a different reskin for BF and GF:

- Week 2 - Haloween Costumes (drip)
- Week 4 - Date outfits(?)
- Week 5 - Winter/Christmas (duh)

# Dope Ass Effects

These effects are pretty cool (and a pain in the ass to code in)

These Include;
- Fade and Flash (Dims the game slightly while the screen will flash a color depending on what note you hit (NOTE THAT IF FLASHING LIGHTS IS OFF, THIS EFFECT WONT WORK!) The camera will also zoom in intensl with every beat)
- Hide Opnt. Note (Self Explanitory);
- Mid Song Cutscene (Hides Hud and a char will do a cool pose (the cam will zoom on them))
- Intense HUD zoom (zoom in the hud on every beat)
- Note Center (Turns on middlescroll on AND puts the notes in the DEAD CENTER of the screen
- Lovey Dovey (Turns on heart particles that float accross the screen (very cool))
- Hypnotizing Movement (Moves the camera smoothly (sexily))

# Stages

The stage redesign is absolutely dope 

heres some cool thing that they do

- WEEK 1 STAGE - The time of day will change based on how far you##'ve progressed throughout the week
- WEEK 2 STAGE - The thunder effect is COMPLETELY RANDOM! the camera is also zoomed out more AND the stars move as the song progresses
- WEEK 3 STAGE - Gf's hair wont blow because it take place indoors. HOWEVER, helicopter helicopter.
- WEEK 4 STAGE - Nothing much changes, BUT bf's death screen will change to him fucking dying
- WEEK 5 STAGE - Santa fucking dies

# Dialogue

The dialogue box sprites have been reworked to make low end PC guys' computer run the game better when dialogue starts.

There is also a cool arrow button 😎

The portraits are not animated YET however there are a BUNCH of expresions to choose from (If you want to make like a fan mod or something)

# Engine Reworks

FNF Left Sides is built on what I think is version 4.3 of Psyche Engine **WITH** some engine reworks from me

This includes,
- The Better Menu.
- New Rating Strings.
- Loading Screen
- Warning Menu
- S̶̛̛̘̖̰̝̒͌̍̈̇͝O̴̢̙͖̻̭̬̟͍͐́̏̐̀̅̕͘͜Ù̵̯͖̟̫͎̔͠N̴̡̧̬̹̺̰̦͚̣̝̑̊Ḑ̴̛̩̫̫̺̠͍̬̩̓͝Ţ̸͈͈͙͛́͂́͛̏͋̐̏̂͝E̴̛̟̮͖̣̪̊͜S̶͙̤̦̰͍͈̒͑́̽̓̿̅̀̓̅ͅT̶̛͙̩̝̭͚̬̂̈͛͑ ̶̛̝̟̠̜̪̱͎͈̗͇͌̏͂̐̊̈́M̷̛̳̹̥͔̄̈́̕͜Ę̸̢̮̞̰̲̠͍̋̋͋̌̌͜Ǹ̷̟̙͕̰̜̤̪͈͂̏͌Ǘ̸͚̯̀̑̌́̆̽
