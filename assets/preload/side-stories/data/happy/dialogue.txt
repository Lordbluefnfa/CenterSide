none|piss|...I don't even know what to say!|tessRoomNight|ben
none|piss|Tess and I are actually dating now!
none|piss|Apparently she has had feelings for a very long time...
none|piss|...As did I.
none|piss|But we were both...to scared to say anything or something...
none|piss|Anyways, I beat her dad's ass in a "singing competition" and now we are watching something on TV before I have to go back and do school stuff.
none|piss|Tess has her head resting on my shoulders after I pulled that cheesy ass "yawn and stretch" thingny...Look I dunno what to call it but I think I know what I mean.
none|piss|The episode of the show we were watching ends, and we both struggle to pull ourselfs out from the realm of snuggles.
ben|happy|I've gotta get going...||default
tess|hmph|But I don't want you too...
ben|the-rock|But- You are still gonna call me at eleven, right?
tess|happy|Oh right, I forgot I said that.
ben|heehee|Uh huh.
tess|stop-being-cute|Can I umm...w-walk you out?...
ben|happy|I do not see why not.
none|piss|...
none|piss|Sooner or later we end up at the doorstep outside. It's cold because October but I'm not trying to make a scene...|nightSky|ben
tess|cute-blushing|Promise me that you'll make it home safe, eat dinner, and finish up schoolwork?||default
ben|happy|Promise.
tess|happy|Okie dokie!
tess|stop-being-cute|I...l-love you...
ben|flustered|...I love you too...
none|piss|She gives me a kiss, and then hugs me.||ben
none|piss|I give her a kiss back and proceed the journey back to my house.
none|piss|I don't know if this day could get ANY better...
none|piss|...
none|piss|I can't believe it...he actually said yes!!|black|tess
none|piss|...
none|piss|Damnit, I forgot to tell him how fast my heart was beating when I was confessing to him haha.
none|piss|As I didn't really have a good coat on, I walk into my house cheerfully.
none|piss|My mood is a lot better than a few days ago, and I'm really happy about that.
none|piss|...
none|piss|Shit. Mom's home now...
none|piss|I quietly retreat to my room. Making sure not to make any noticable noises.
none|piss|...
none|piss|I start to think about how much time I have until I can call Ben after closing and locking my bedroom door.|tessRoomNight
none|piss|Jeez, I have a ton of freetime before I can call Ben...
none|piss|I could draw something for him...I can...umm....
none|piss|Damnit, I can't stop thinking about him, can I?
none|piss|I can't help it though...He's just too perfect...
none|piss|His great sense of humor, his kindness and empathy towards me, the way he gets lost in himself when playing the piano and he's so smart...
none|piss|Goddamn...He's pretty hot to be honest...
none|piss|!-
none|piss|The sudden pounds startle me. I instantly curl into a ball in fear.
none|piss|"TESS. OPEN THIS GODDAMN DOOR NOW."||yell
tess|curl|...p-please stop...not today...||default
none|piss|"Tess, if you don't open this door now. I swear to god, I will have your father get that fucking lock removed from your door."
none|piss|I start to cry from the pressure that's being put on me.||tess
none|piss|"You fucking hear me, whore? Open the door."||default
tess|curl-angry|Don't call me that!!||yell
none|piss|"YOU WANT ME TO BREAK YOUR ARM AGAIN? LISTEN TO US AND OPEN THE DOOR."
tess|curl-angry|FINE.
none|piss|I quickly get up and open the door. Before quickly retreating next to my bed where I curl up again. Watching every move my parents make.||tess
none|piss|They both yell at me for embarrasing my dad. Calling me foul names while I sit on the floor, sobbing.|black
none|piss|Between my sobs I manage to get a scentence out after they settle the verbal beat down.
tess|curl|I fucking hate both of you! I'm gonna fucking leave this hellhole and never come back after I fucking tell my boyfriend about you tw-||default
none|piss|Dad then picks me up from the collar of my dress and shoves me to the floor before hitting me repeatedly.||tess
none|piss|I curl into a ball just in time so most of the blows hit my back.
none|piss|However, other areas get hit too.
none|piss|Trying to fight back is useless.
none|piss|The last time I tried to, my jaw got dislocated.
none|piss|After what seemed like forever, both my parents tell me not to embarrass any of them before my dad kicks my weak body.
none|piss|They both leave the room with me sobbing.
none|piss|I now have a black eye, bloody nose and a spot where a bruise will definetly form on my neck.
none|piss|Great. Just another thing to cover up...
none|piss|I cry in my bed while trying to figure out what to say to ben when he asks about my sowlen eye and runny nose...
none|piss|I mean- I can just blame it on my allergies...
none|piss|That, and I have to prepare to put on my "Happy Face" facade for him...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Well, thats the last of the dreadful school work.||ben
none|piss|Annnnd it's only eight...great...
none|piss|Already feeling love sick.
none|piss|Guess I'm just gonna play video games until my phone rings...Oh- and I need to make food...
none|piss|...
none|piss|My phone finally rings...I close down my game before answering the phone.
ben|happy|Hey babe!||default
phone|tess|Hi b-babe!!
phone|tess|Did you um... *sniffle* ...do everything that you promissed to do?
ben|heehee|Absolutely.
ben|the-rock|Wait- What's up with your eye?
phone|tess|Umm...
phone|tess|I kinda had snuggles with my mom's cat...
phone|tess|And my allergies make me look terrible...
ben|oh|Oh.
ben|confused|You gotta stop cuddling with cats when you know that you're gonna get a reaction...
phone|tess|But they're soooo cute and soft...
ben|guilt|...
ben|confused|...M'kay, fair point...
none|piss|...
none|piss|We're still talking at 2:30. Talking about various topics such as "What a cool first date would be" and...||ben
none|piss|...Nerdy Stuff.
phone|tess|*yawn* ...Yikes it's getting late...||default
ben|the-rock|You wanna call it a night?
phone|tess|Nah. I'm not tired.
ben|heehee|Buuuuuut I heard someone yawn earlier...
phone|tess|Uh...
phone|tess|...You?
ben|confused|That ain't me.
phone|tess|Okay, fine fine.
phone|tess|You wanna just fall asleep on call?
ben|happy|Sure!
phone|tess|Okay...Lemme just shower and change before going to sleep...
phone|tess|I'll put something nice on, just for you~
none|piss|I try my best to recreate Cr1tiKal's "Wooo Yeah Baby" thingy in light of this||ben
phone|tess|Ha! Later goofball.||default
none|piss|She excuses herself to her shower and mutes herself.||ben
none|piss|...Which is making me bored already.
none|piss|I wonder if I could surprise her by giving her stuff in our Minecraft world...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Tess returns after a while, apologizing for her absence.
none|piss|I tell her "no worries" before she flashes a small smile on her face.
phone|tess|Oh- Um....what do you think of my um...outfit...?||default
none|piss|Tess is wearing a oversized long sleeved black shirt while matching with her black short-shorts.||ben
ben|happy|...Damn you look *really* cute...||default
none|piss|She lets out a soft giggle while blushing at my comment.||ben
ben|confused|And yet I always look like a gremlin whenever I get out of the shower...||default
phone|tess|That's because I take my time to dry my hair off, silly goose.
ben|happy|I have better things to do than rub my head with a towel, thank you very much.
phone|tess|Then just buy a hair dryer, easy fix.
ben|confused|But I'm too lazy.
phone|tess|Then I'll dry your hair myself.
ben|happy|Fine.
none|piss|Our debate settles down, and we start to drift off...||ben
phone|tess|I wish you were in bed with me right now...||default
ben|the-rock|How come?
phone|tess|Ummm...Cuddles...Oh- and you make the atmosphere more relaxing...
phone|tess|However I think your bed is better...
phone|tess|...It's like sleeping on a cloud...and the blankets are warmer.
ben|the-rock|Compared to yours...?
phone|tess|Sleeping on a goddamn stone tablet.
ben|confused|...I dunno 'bout that one.
ben|happy|...Goodnight! Sweet Dreams, don't let the bed bugs bite or else I'll kick their asses...And I love you...
phone|tess|Haha! Love you too...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...||tess
none|piss|What would he do if I took my original plans from three days ago a step further instead of doing that thing with him?
none|piss|...He would've had nothing left.
none|piss|I'm his rock.
none|piss|I just need to power through...
none|piss|...I still can't belive I thought of doing that to him...
none|piss|...It would hurt so much...
none|piss|I can't help but think about if over and over...
none|piss|...
