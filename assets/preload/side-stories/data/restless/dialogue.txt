none|piss|Why am I not waking up from this nightmare??
none|piss|...I can't...I can't fucking get that image out of my head...
none|piss|I keep coming back to that...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Deep breaths...Deep breaths...
none|piss|...
none|piss|*soft knocks*||default
yTess|concerned|Hey...Just wanted to check up on you before I head to bed...
yBen|down|...I'm fine...
yTess|concerned|Do you want me to get you anything?
none|piss|She sits down next to me on my bed and wipes away a tear still on my cheek.||ben
yBen|down|C-can you heat up a bowl of leftover pasta for me?||default
yTess|comfort|M'kay...
none|piss|...
none|piss|After a few minutes, she returns with my food.||ben
yBen|down|Thanks...||default
yTess|comfort|You're welcome...
yTess|concerned|...I'm gonna head to bed now, so...goodnight...
yBen|down|Night...
none|piss|She gets up and walks to the door leading out of my bedroom, flashing me a comforting smile.||ben
none|piss|I try to go to bed.|black
none|piss|But...
none|piss|My mind...is plagued with...blood everyhwere...that 'boom' sound...
none|piss|Everytime I close my eyes...it just replays...opening the door...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Everytime I make glances around my room I swear I can see something watching me...
none|piss|!-
none|piss|Something small hit my window.
none|piss|I turn around to investigate and...
none|piss|...My father is outside...?
none|piss|No.
none|piss|This is impossible
none|piss|...This is fucking impossible...
none|piss|Mom told me he died when I was...not even three.
none|piss|He looks straight at me. And then looks as if he points at something that's behind me...His expression changes from blank to horrified...
none|piss|And then explodes into a pile of flesh.
none|piss|I recoil from fear and disgust before looking behind me.
none|piss|Nothing.
none|piss|...
none|piss|I then get probably the worst headache of my entire life.
none|piss|Everything gets...overwhelming...
none|piss|My mom died today, I just saw someone who looks like my dad explode into nothing but blood and gore and now my body is throwing this at me?!
none|piss|FUCK.
none|piss|...I actually try to get out of bed for once. The intesnity of the headache makes me walk all wonkity.
none|piss|I quietly open the door to go downstairs and get my hands on any pain reliever I can find...
none|piss|...Everything looks fuzzy to me and the ringing in my ears is almost deafening..|black
none|piss|...||default
yTess|concerned|Ben?
yTess|concerned|Are you okay?
yBen|down|Yeah...*painful grunt*..I jus-just have a really bad headache...And I'm gonna get an Advil or something..
yTess|concerned|Nonono, Let me get it for you, I think you should get back to bed and rest...
yBen|down|*sharp inhale*...kay...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...I'm really glad Tess wanted to stay the night with me.||ben
none|piss|If it wasn't for her, I probably would have fallen down the stairs...
yTess|comfort|Here you go...||default
yTess|concerned|Do you want more food or anything?
yBen|down|I-I'm fine...thank you though...
yTess|comfort|Okay...
none|piss|She takes the hand thats resting on my knee, and affectionately squeezes it.||ben
yTess|comfort|I cam umm...Get delivery for breakfast in the morning. But I have to leave for a dentist appointment before lunch...||default
yTess|down|And then I have to go back home after that...
yBen|down|Okay...
yTess|comfort|And then I'll come to help you pack in a few days, right?
yBen|down|Yeah...
yTess|comfort|Okay, get some sleep for me, please..
yTess|joking|And no 5 am gaming sessions, Mister.
yBen|downsmile|N-no promises.
yTess|joking|Okay, silly.
none|piss|She gives me a hug before leaving to the couch in the living room.||ben
none|piss|...
none|piss|I try my hardest to sleep, but something always snaps me awake...|black
none|piss|I don't know why but...I think I'm hearing Mom or Tess whispering my name...and yet- nobody's in the room...
none|piss|Am I going crazy?!
none|piss|I boot up Skyrim just to drain out the noises...
none|piss|It does a decent job at it.
none|piss|3:47 rolls around and...I hear a gunshot.
none|piss|I let out a short yelp before hyperventalating.
none|piss|I then hear footsteps running up the stairs.
none|piss|I'm petrified to the core, my breathing becoming quicker and heavier along with my heart pounding faster.
none|piss|The door opens slowly...
none|piss|Tess walks in, and I start to calm down.
yTess|away|Ben?||default
yBen|horrified|Y-yeah..?
yTess|away|...
yTess|monster|What did you do to your Mother?||dark|962424

none|piss|"GO AWAY! GO AWAY!"||default
none|piss|...||ben
none|piss|Minutes pass, and I finally open my eyes a bit.
none|piss|That thing is still staring at me...
yTess|monster|...||dark
yTess|horrified|Ben?!||default
